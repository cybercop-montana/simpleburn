- These functions will be added in LibCDIO (already in Git 
version); "_" prefix prevents conflicts.
- In LibCDIO, some functions prototypes have been changed to 
be more consistent with the rest of the library.
- As soon as new LibCDIO version will be available in Slackware, 
"simpleburn-cdio-media-detection.c" will be patched and this 
temporary directory removed.
